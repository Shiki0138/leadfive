# HP Infrastructure Testing Framework

## Overview
This testing framework validates the complete HP infrastructure deployment including servers, storage, networking, and management tools.

## Test Components

### 1. Server Testing
- Hardware diagnostics and stress testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Firmware validation
- iLO functionality testing

### 2. Storage Testing
- Performance benchmarks (IOPS, throughput, latency)
- Redundancy validation
- Data protection testing
- Storage management validation

### 3. Network Testing
- Connectivity validation
- Throughput testing
- VLAN configuration testing
- Security validation

### 4. Management Tools Testing
- HP OneView functionality
- iLO Advanced features
- Automation tools validation
- Monitoring and alerting

### 5. Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflows
- Cross-component communication
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Backup and restore validation

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- HP infrastructure deployed and configured
- Test credentials and access configured
- Testing tools installed

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./run-all-tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
./test-suites/server-tests/run-tests.sh
./test-suites/storage-tests/run-tests.sh
./test-suites/network-tests/run-tests.sh
./test-suites/management-tests/run-tests.sh
./test-suites/integration-tests/run-tests.sh
```

## Test Results
All test results are stored in:
- `test-results/` - Detailed test outputs
- `reports/` - Summary reports and metrics
- `logs/` - Test execution logs

## Issue Tracking
Identified issues are documented in `issues/` directory with:
- Severity classification
- Impact assessment
- Remediation steps
- Resolution tracking
