# LeadFive Website Architecture Summary

## Project Overview
The LeadFive website renewal project combines human psychology insights (8 fundamental desires) with AI-powered marketing solutions to create a cutting-edge digital experience.

## Architecture Decision Summary

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router (chosen for performance, SEO, and developer experience)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (utility-first with smooth animations)
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js/React Three Fiber (interactive visualizations)
- **CMS**: Headless WordPress (familiar content management with API flexibility)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 & DALL-E 3 (best-in-class AI capabilities)
- **Deployment**: Vercel + Cloudflare (optimized for Next.js with global CDN)

### 2. Architecture Type
- **Hybrid JAMstack**: Combining static generation with dynamic API routes
- **Microservices Pattern**: Separate services for content, AI, and analytics
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time updates via WebSockets and Server-Sent Events

### 3. Key Design Decisions

#### Performance First
- Target Lighthouse score: 95+
- Aggressive caching at multiple layers
- Progressive enhancement for 3D features
- Image optimization with Next.js Image

#### Security by Design
- Zero-trust architecture
- Input validation at every layer
- Rate limiting on all APIs
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit

#### Scalability Built-In
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Microservices architecture
- CDN for global distribution
- Efficient caching strategies

### 4. Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Small, reusable components
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organized by functionality
- **Shared UI Library**: Consistent design system
- **TypeScript Throughout**: Type safety and better DX

### 5. Data Flow
- **Unidirectional**: Clear data flow patterns
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity
- **API Layer**: Abstracted data fetching
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration

### 6. AI Integration Strategy
- **Streaming Responses**: Better UX for chat
- **Queue System**: Handle rate limits gracefully
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart caching of responses
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation
