## The Psychological Summary

This flow takes CEOs from:
1. Recognition ("That's me")
2. Agitation ("This is painful")
3. Hope ("Others escaped")
4. Understanding ("Now I see the difference")
5. Belief ("This could work")
6. Confidence ("My concerns are addressed")
7. Desire ("I want this")
8. Vision ("This is my future")
9. Urgency ("I need to act now")
10. Action ("Let's start")

Each section builds on the previous, creating inevitable momentum toward engagement. The consistent thread: Implementation over information, building over talking, results over reports.

The CEO who reaches the bottom hasn't just read a website - they've experienced a revelation about what's been holding them back and seen a clear path forward. The only logical next step is to take action.
